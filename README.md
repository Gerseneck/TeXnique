A LaTeX speed-typesetting game. How many formulas can you recreate in three minutes?

## Cascade queries
After someone is done with the game, help me implement a feature where people can submit their scores to a leaderboard (by typing in their name, max 30 chars), and toggle between the top 10 from today, this month, and all-time. I added firebase boilerplate and I have a leaderboard collection with name, score, and timestamp. Please don't create new files. Thank you!

Help me add a cute Wordle-style share button at the end of the game
